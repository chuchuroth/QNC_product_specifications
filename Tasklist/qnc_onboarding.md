Since you are onboarding onto a hardware-software hybrid project (an **End-of-Arm Tooling** or **EoAT** project), your process is more complex than a standard software-only role. You need to understand the mechanical constraints, the electrical power requirements, and the communication logic.

Here is a step-by-step roadmap to get you "up to speed."

---

## Phase 1: Mechanical & Physical Constraints

Before looking at code or circuits, you must understand where the device lives.

1. **Flange Standards:** Identify which robot brands you are supporting (FANUC, Universal Robots, KUKA, etc.). Most use **ISO 9409-1** bolt patterns.
2. **Payload & Moment:** Learn the weight limits. Every gram your device weighs subtracts from what the robot can actually lift.
3. **Cable Management (Dress Pack):** Understand how the cables will reach the flange without snapping or tangling during high-speed robot movements.

## Phase 2: Electrical & Power Architecture

Since this device powers various grippers, you are essentially building a "smart hub."

1. **Power Supply:** Determine the voltage (usually **24V DC** for industrial robots) and the peak current the device can handle.
2. **Pinout Mapping:** Review the schematics for the internal wiring. How does power get from the robot arm through your device to the gripper?
3. **Circuit Protection:** Identify the fuses or E-stop integrations that prevent the device from frying if a gripper shorts out.

## Phase 3: Communication Protocols (The "Bridge")

This is likely the core of your work. You are building a translator for different "languages."

1. **Review Supported Protocols:** You will likely deal with a mix of:
* **IO-Link:** Very common for modern smart grippers.
* **EtherNet/IP or PROFINET:** For high-speed data.
* **Modbus TCP/RTU:** Common in legacy or low-cost systems.
* **Digital I/O:** Simple High/Low signals.


2. **The Logic Layer:** Study the firmware or software that detects which gripper is attached and switches the protocol accordingly.

## Phase 4: Environment & Safety Setup

1. **SDKs and Libraries:** Install the specific Robot Operating System (ROS) drivers or proprietary manufacturer APIs (like URCaps for Universal Robots).
2. **The "Sandbox":** Get access to the testing bench.
> **Note:** Never test new code on a live robot arm without a "Dry Run" or a physical E-Stop in your hand.

## Summary Checklist for Your First Week

| Task Category | Action Item |
| --- | --- |
| **Documentation** | Read the "Theory of Operation" and the "Interface Control Document" (ICD). |
| **Hardware** | Get a physical unit and take it apart (if allowed) to see the PCB and mounting. |
| **Code/Logic** | Clone the repository and run a simulation of the protocol switching logic. |
| **Safety** | Complete the lab safety walkthrough regarding high-voltage and robot motion zones. |

Would you like me to help you draft a list of technical questions to ask your new Lead Engineer to show you’re thinking about the right integration challenges?

Since your focus is strictly on the **software layer**, your onboarding shifts from the physical hardware to the **middleware**—the logic that allows the robot to talk to the device, and the device to talk to the grippers.

Here is your software-centric onboarding roadmap:

## Phase 1: The Stack & Architecture

Before writing code, you need to understand how the data flows from the robot's "brain" through your device.

1. **Review the Communication Stack:** Identify where your code lives. Is it firmware on an MCU (like an STM32 or ESP32), or a high-level driver running on a Linux-based robot controller?
2. **Protocol Mapping:** Since you support multiple protocols, study the **Abstraction Layer**. How does the software identify a Modbus gripper vs. an IO-Link gripper?
3. **Data Structures:** Review the "Payload" definitions. You need to know how "Grip Strength," "Position," and "Status" are packed into bytes for different protocols.

## Phase 2: Development Environment Setup

1. **Toolchain Installation:** Set up your IDE (e.g., VS Code, CLion), compilers (e.g., GCC Arm), and debuggers (e.g., J-Link, ST-Link).
2. **Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) Setup:** Connect your computer to a "Dev Kit" version of the electrical device. You’ll need to be able to flash code and read serial logs without needing a full robot arm yet.
3. **Simulators & Emulators:** Find out if there is a "Mock Gripper" or a "Robot Simulator" so you can test your protocol switching logic virtually.

## Phase 3: The Core Logic Tasks

As the software person, these are the "heavy hitters" you'll likely tackle first:

* **Handshaking:** The logic that confirms the device is properly mounted and powered.
* **The "Translator" (Protocol Bridge):** If the Robot speaks **EtherNet/IP** but the Gripper speaks **IO-Link**, your software must translate those packets in real-time with minimal latency.
* **Error Handling:** What happens in the code if a gripper is unplugged while the robot is moving? (Timeout logic, E-stop triggers).
* **Update Mechanism:** How does the device receive firmware updates once it's already mounted on a customer's robot? (OTA updates or USB).

## Your "First Week" Software Checklist

| Priority | Task | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Repo Exploration** | Understand the naming conventions and branching strategy (Git). |
| **2** | **Build the Project** | Ensure you can compile the current source code without errors. |
| **3** | **Trace a Command** | Follow a "Close Gripper" command from the UI all the way to the electrical output. |
| **4** | **Logging & Debugging** | Learn how to access the "Panic" logs or error stack traces. |

### Pro-Tip for Software Engineers in Robotics

Ask for the **"Interface Control Document" (ICD)** immediately. This document defines exactly how the software components are supposed to talk to each other. If it doesn't exist, making one is a great way to "onboard" yourself effectively.

Would you like me to explain how a specific protocol, like **IO-Link** or **Modbus**, typically looks in code?
